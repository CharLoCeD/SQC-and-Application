\section{Introduction}

Let $\T$ be a Horn theory.  $\T$. This principle originated from the observation made in~\cite{RN879}, that the function space of the generic model $U_\T$ in the classifying topos $\Set[\T]$ is calculated by polynomials $U_\T[x]$. This then  The  ~\cite{blechschmidt2021using,blechschmidt2020general}. (The envelopping $\infty$-topoi of) such topoi provide models for the type theory we work with in this paper.

In this paper we will be working in a dependent type theory with a univalent universe $\tp$. Recall the notion of $h$-levels~\cite{hottbook}. For us the most important h-levels are -1 and 0, which are \emph{propositions} and \emph{sets}. In particular, we can define subuniverses $\pp$, $\st$.

We will also assume the existence of propositional truncation. This allows us to define existential quantifier of a family $P : X \to \pp$, 
\[ \ex x{X} P(x) := \pss{\sum_{x:X}P(x)} \] 
and disjunction of propositions,
\[ P \vee Q := \pss{P + Q}. \]
Note that by univalence, $\pp$ is already closed under dependent product. But to emphasis that the result is again a proposition, we may also write dependent products of propositions as $\fa xX P(x)$. 

The universe $\pp$ is used to define subtypes, i.e. we identify a subtype of $X$ as a family of propositions $A : X \to \pp$ indexed over $X$, where the projection $\sum_{x:X}A(x) \inj X$ is the inclusion of this subtype. We often write the sum as a collection,
\[ \scomp{x:X}{A(x)} := \sum_{x:X}A(x). \]
When $X$ in fact is a set, then any of its subtype is also a set, and we will emphasis by calling them \emph{subsets}.

Sets are used to define \emph{algebras} for a Horn theory. Given any Horn theory $\T$, by a \emph{$\T$-model} we will always mean a \emph{set} $A$ equipped with operations according to the signature of $\T$, such that it satisfies the axioms of $\T$. Since $A$ is a set, being a $\T$-model is again a proposition for a given family of operations.

At the end, we remark that $\N$ is the usual inductive type of natural numbers. For any $n:\N$, we will also use $n$ to denote the finite type with $n$ elements, which is viewed as an initial segment of $\N$. We stress that this is only syntactic sugar, and can be made more precise if need be.

\section{Quasi-coherence and affine spaces}

In this section we discuss the notion of quasi-coherent algebra and affine spaces. The technical results presented in this section is essentially contained in~\cite{Cherubini_Coquand_Hutzler_2024}, based on the work in~\cite{blechschmidt2021using}. 

As a starting point, we assume there is a generic $\T$-model in our type system:

\begin{axiom}
  There is a set $\I$ equipped with a $\T$-model structure.
\end{axiom}

\emph{Quasi-coherence} is a condition on \emph{$\I$-algebras}: An $\I$-algebra is a $\T$-model $A$ equipped with a homomorphism $\I \to A$. The type of $\I$-algebras will be denoted as $\I\alg$. More generally, for any $\T$-algebras $A,B$, we will use $\I\alg(A,B)$ to denote the set of homomorphisms of $\I$-algebras from $A$ to $B$. For instance, this can be used to define the \emph{spectrum} $A$,
\[ \spec A := \I\alg(A,\I). \]

A lot of sets can be naturally viewed as the spectrum of some $\I$-algebra. For the simplest example, since $\I$ is the initial $\I$-algebra,
\[ \spec \I = \I\alg(\I,\I) = 1. \]
Now if we use $\I[x]$ to denote the free $\I$ algebra on one generator, we can identify $\I$ itself as a spectrum,
\[ \spec \I[x] = \I\alg(\I[x],\I) = \I. \]
However, notationally we will distinguish $\I$ as an algebraic gagdet and as a spectrum, which we view as a geometrical object. The latter will be denoted as $\I$, and the equivalence $\I \to \I$ takes $i : \I$ to the evaluation map $\ev_i : \I[x] \to \I$. More generally, we have:

\begin{example}\label{exm:cubeaffine}
  For any $n:\N$, the $n$-th cube $\I^n$ is the following spectrum,
  \[ \spec \I[n] = \I\alg(\I[n],\I) = \I^n. \]
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
  $A$ is \emph{quasi-coherent}, if the canonical evaluation
  \[ A \to \I^{\spec A} \]
  is an equivalence of $\I$-algebras, where $\I^{\spec A}$ has the point-wise $\I$-algebra structure. We write $\ms{isQC}(A)$ for the proposition of being quasi-coherent.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{rem:qcreplete}
  If $A$ is quasi-coherent, then it is in particular \emph{replete}, in the sense that for any map $f : X \to Y$ where $\I^f$ is an equivalence, $A^f$ is also an equivalence. 
\end{remark}

\begin{example}\label{exm:intervalqc}
  $\I$ itself by definition is quasi-coherent. We have seen that $\spec \I = 1$. Under this equivalence, the canonical map 
  \[ \I \to \I^{\spec \I} = \I \]
  is exactly the identity on $\I$, hence is an equivalence.
\end{example}

Note by construction, $\spec$ is a contravariant functor on $\I$-algebras. For quasi-coherent algebras, we have a more general duality result:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:duality}
  If $B$ is quasi-coherent, then for any $\I$-algebras $A$, we have
  \[ \I\alg(B,A) = \spec B^{\spec A}. \]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  By quasi-coherence of $B$, we have the following equivalences,
  \[ \I\alg(A,B) = \I\alg(A,\I^{\spec B}) = \I\alg(A,\I)^{\spec B} = \spec A^{\spec B}. \]
  The second identity holds since by quasi-coherence the $\I$-algebra structure on $\I^{\spec B}$ is point-wise.
\end{proof}

The above duality result tells us that we can infer equivalence of algebras via equivalence of their spectrum:

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:dualityeqv}
  For any $f : \I\alg(A,B)$, if $A,B$ are quasi-coherent, then $f$ is an equivalence iff it induces an equivalence $\spec B \to \spec A$. 
\end{corollary}

To illustrate the usefulness of the above duality result, let us also introduce the following notion: 
\begin{definition}
  We say an $\I$-algebra $A$ is \emph{stably quasi-coherent} if all finitely generated principle congruences of $A$ are also quasi-coherent, i.e. for any finite $n : \N$ and for any $a,b : n \to A$, $A/a = b$ is again quasi-coherent.
\end{definition}
 
By definition, any finitely generated principle congruences of a stably quasi-coherent algebra will again be stably quasi-coherent. For a stably quasi-coherent $\I$-algebra $A$,  its spectrum always ``has enough points'' to distinguish elements:

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:completeness}
  For any stably quasi-coherent $\I$-algebra $A$ and for any $a,b : A$,
  \[ a = b \eq \fa x{\spec A} xa = xb. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The $\nt$ direction is trivial. For $\Leftarrow$, by the universal property of the quotient $A/a = b$, we have
  \[ \spec(A/a = b) = \scomp{x : \spec A}{xa = xb} \subseteq \spec A. \]
  If $\fa x{\spec A}xa = xb$ holds, then the inclusion $\spec(A/a = b) \inj \spec A$ is an equivalence. Since by assumption $A/a=b$ is also quasi-coherent, by Corollary~\ref{cor:dualityeqv} the quotient $A \surj A/a=b$ is an equivalence. This exactly says $a = b$.
\end{proof}

Dually, we can use quasi-coherence to define the notion of \emph{affine spaces}:

\begin{definition}
  We say a set $X$ is \emph{affine}, if $\I^X$ is quasi-coherent, and the canonical evaluation map
  \[ X \to \spec \I^X \]
  is an equivalence. Similarly, we say $X$ is \emph{stably affine} if $\I^X$ is furthermore stably quasi-coherent.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  For any set $X$, $X$ is (stably) affine iff there exists a (stably) quasi-coherent $A$ such that $X = \spec A$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  The only if direction holds by definition, since $A$ can be taken as $\I^X$. For the if direction, it suffices to show $\spec A$ is affine whenever $A$ is quasi-coherent. Now by quasi-coherence, $A = \I^{\spec A}$ thus $\I^{\spec A}$ is quasi-coherent. Furthermore, the canonical map $\spec A \to \spec \I^{\spec A}$ is an equivalence again by quasi-coherence of $A$.
\end{proof}

At the end of this section, we describe finite limits of affine spaces. By Example~\ref{exm:intervalqc}, the terminal type $1$ is affine. More generally, pullbacks of affine spaces can be computed as a spectrum:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:pullbackofaffine}
  Let $A,B,C$ be $\I$-algebras. Given $f : \I\alg(B,A)$ and $g : \I\alg(B,C)$, the pullback of $\spec f$ and $\spec g$ is given by the spectrum
  \[ \spec A \times_{\spec B} \spec C = \spec (A \otimes_B C), \]
  where $A \otimes_B C$ is the following pushout of $\I$-algebras,
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      B \ar[r, "f"] \ar[d, "g"'] & A \ar[d] \\
      C \ar[r] & A \otimes_B C
      \arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125, rotate=180}, draw=none, from=2-2, to=1-1]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  This essentially holds by the universal property of the pushout.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  Notice that in the above result, if $\spec B$ is affine, then by Proposition~\ref{prop:duality} any map from $\spec A$ to $\spec B$ is induced by an $\I$-algebra morphism, and similarly for $\spec C$. Thus, any such pullback will be computed as a spectrum.
\end{remark}

Following~\cite{Cherubini_Coquand_Hutzler_2024}, the above result provides an extremely easy formula to compute the coproducts of quasi-coherent algebras:

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:tensorasspace}
  For any $\I$-algebra $A,B$, if $B$ is quasi-coherent, then there is an equivalence
  \[ \I^{\spec A \otimes B} = B^{\spec A}. \]
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Since $1$ is affine, $\spec A \times \spec B$ can be computed as $\spec A \otimes B$. Then by quasi-coherence of $B$, we have
  \[ \I^{\spec(A \otimes B)} = \I^{\spec A \times \spec B} = B^{\spec A}. \]
  Following this equivalence, the evaluation map $A \otimes B \to \I^{\spec A \otimes B}$ is exactly the one given above.
\end{proof}

Under the above identification, if $B$ is quasi-coherent, then the canonical map $A \otimes B \to \I^{\spec A \otimes B}$ can be equivalently viewed as the following map 
\[ c \mapsto \ld{x}{\spec A} (x\otimes B)(c) : A \otimes B \to B^{\spec A}. \]
Of course when $A \otimes B$ is quasi-coherent, then the above map will again be an equivalence. We can similarly calculate the canonical inclusions. For the left inclusion $A \to A \otimes B$, given any $a : A$ and $x : \spec A$,
\[ (x \otimes B)(a \otimes 1) = xa, \]
where we view $xa : \I$ as an element in $B$ using its an $\I$-algebra. For the right inclusion $B \to A \otimes B = B^{\spec A}$, for any $b : B$ and $x : \spec A$,
\[ (x \otimes B)(1 \otimes b) = b, \]
which implies the image of $b$ is simply the constant function on $b$.


\section{Open propositions and dominance}\label{sec:dominance}

Notice that up till this piont we have not used any spectial property of $\T$ rather than the fact that it is a Horn theory. However, to move closer to the intended application in domain theory, we start by assuming our theory $\T$ is \emph{propositional}: 

\begin{definition}
  We say a Horn theory $\T$ is \emph{propositional}, if it extends the theory of meet-semi-lattices, and truth of an element is computed by slicing: For any $\T$-model $A$ and $a:A$, the quotient $A/a=1$ is given by
  \[ a \wedge - : A \surj A/a, \]
  where $A/a$ by definition is $\cv a := \scomp{b:A}{b\le a}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  The theory $\mbb M$ of meet-semi-lattices, $\mbb D$ of distributive lattices, $\mbb H$ of Heyting algebras, and $\mbb B$ of Boolean algebras are all examples of propositional theories in the above sense. In fact, all finitary quotients of $\mbb H$ or $\mbb B$ will again be propositional. More generally, for any propositional theory $\T$ and any $\T$-model $D$, the theory of $D$-algebras will again be propositional. We call such a theory a theory of $\T$-algebra.
\end{remark}

For a propositional theory $\T$, we think of the generic model $\I$ as certain interval object, since it is equipped with a partial order. For propositional theories, more sets can be realised as spectrums. The important examples are \emph{simplices}:

\begin{example}\label{exm:simplicesaffine}
  For any $n : \N$, let $\Delta^n \subseteq \I^n$ be the following subset,
  \[ \Delta^n := \scomp{i : n \to \I}{i_1 \ge \cdots \ge i_n}. \]
  This type is indeed a spectrum, since by definition we have
  \[ \Delta^n = \spec\I[i_1,\cdots,i_n]/i_1\ge\cdots\ge i_n. \]
  To simplify later discussion, we might also introduce the following types isomorphic to simplices above,
  \[ \Delta_n := \scomp{i : n \to \I}{i_1 \le \cdots \le i_n}. \]
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
  All the cubes $\I^n$ and simplices $\Delta^n,\Delta_n$ are replete. The former holds since replete objects are closed under limits, and the latter holds since they are retracts of $\I^n$ using the meet $\wedge$ operation.
\end{remark}

The constant $1 : \I$, which is the top element in $\I$, induces a predicate
\[ \ms t : \I \to \pp, \]
which takes $i : \I$ to the proposition $i = 1$. The first observation is that $\ms t$ takes $i : \I$ to a spectrum:

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:openpropaffine}
  For any $i : \I$, $\ms ti = \spec \I/i$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By definition, $\spec \I/i = \I\alg(\I/i,\I)$. Since $\I \surj \I/i$ is a quotient and $\I$ is the initial $\I$-algebra, there is a homomorphism from $\I/i$ to $\I$ iff $i = 1$, and in this case the map is unique.
\end{proof}

To say something about the propositions that lies in $\ms t$, we assume a minimal amount of axioms:

\begin{axiom}[SQCI]
  $\I$ is stably quasi-coherent.
\end{axiom}

We already know that $\I$ is quasi-coherent. If it is stably so, then in particular for any $i : \I$, the principle congruence $\I/i$ will also be (stably) quasi-coherent. This implies the following result:

\begin{lemma}[SQCI]\label{lem:intconserve}
  The interval $\I$ is conservative,
  \[ \fa{i,j}{\I} (\ms ti \eq \ms tj) \eq i = j. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  It suffices to show
  \[ \fa{i,j}{\I}(\ms ti \to \ms tj) \to i \le j. \]
  Take $i,j$ with $\ms ti \to \ms tj$. By Lemma~\ref{lem:openpropaffine} and (SQCI), each $\ms ti$ and $\ms tj$ will be affine. Then we get a restriction map between $\I$-algebras,
  \[ \I/j = \I^{\ms tj} \to \I^{\ms ti} = \I/i. \]
  By the universal property of the quotient and the fact that $\T$ is a propositional theory, such a map exists iff $i \le j$.
\end{proof}

Thus, under (SQCI), we may view the generic algebra $\I$ as a subuniverse of \emph{open} propositions via the embedding $\ms t$:

\begin{definition}[SQCI]
  Given a proposition $p$, we say it is \emph{open} if $p$ is of the form $\ms ti$ for some $i$ in $\I$,
  \[ \ms{isopen}(p) := \sum_{i:\I}p \eq \ms ti. \]
\end{definition}

By Lemma~\ref{lem:intconserve}, the $i$ that $p \eq \ms ti$ will be unique, thus being open is a proposition. Also, open propositions are evidently closed under finite conjunctions, since $\ms t$ preserves them. More generally, we may define the notion of open subtypes:

\begin{definition}[SQCI]
  A subtype $U$ of $X$ is \emph{open}, if for any $x:X$ the proposition $U(x)$ is open,
  \[ \ms{isOpen}(U) := \fa xX \ms{isopen}(U(x)). \]
\end{definition}

In other words, an open proposition is equivalently a map $U : X \to \I$, where the subtype is classified as the following pullback,
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  U \ar[d, hook] \ar[r] & 1 \ar[d] \\ 
  X \ar[r] & \I
  \arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}
\]
This also implies that open subtypes are closed under pullbacks. Note that this crucial depends on conservativity of $\I$. 

If $X$ is affine, open subtypes are easy to classify:

\begin{lemma}[SQCI]\label{lem:openofaffinegivesalgebra}
  Let $X = \spec A$ be affine. Then any open subset of $X$ is of the form $D_a$ for some $a:A$, where
  \[ D_a := \scomp{x : X}{\ms t(xa)} = \spec A/a. \]
  If $X$ is stably affine, then an open subset of it is again stably affine.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  This follows from the fact that the type of opens of $X$ is $\I^X = A$ since $X$ is affine. If $X$ is stably affine, then so is $D_a$.
\end{proof}

One observation from~\cite{Cherubini_Coquand_Hutzler_2024} is that the type of open propositions forms a \emph{dominance} in the sense of~\cite{rosolini1986continuity}. In other words, open propositions are closed under truth and dependent product. The \emph{loc. cit.} uses certain choice principle on affine spaces to show this. However, in our situation the conservativity of the interval $\I$ allows direct computation of the type of open subsets of affine spaces as shown above. Hence, our proof does not require any additional choice principle:

\begin{proposition}[SQCI]\label{prop:Idominance}
  The type of opens $\I$ forms a dominance.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $p$ is an open proposition. By definition $p = \ms ti$ for some $i:\I$. Now if $q$ is an open subset of $p$, since $p = \ms ti$ is affine, Lemma~\ref{lem:openofaffinegivesalgebra} implies that $q = D_j$ for some $j : \I/i$. Since $\T$ is propositional, equivalently $j$ can be viewed as an element $j : \I$ with $j \le i$. This way, $q = \ms tj$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:opentransitive}
  Open subtypes are transitive.
\end{corollary}


\section{Lifting}\label{sec:lifting}

Given then dominance structure $\I$, we can construct internally the lifting functor. For any type $X$, its lift is given by
\[ X\prt := \sum_{i:\I}X^{\ms ti}. \]
The functoriality is easy to express: For any $f : X \to Y$, we have
\[ f\prt(i,x) := (i,\ld{w}{\ms ti}fxw). \]
There is an evident unit $\eta\prt : X \to X\prt$, where
\[ \eta := \ld x X(1,\ld\hp 1 x). \]
The dominance structure on $\I$ also gives a multiplication $\mu : (X\prt)\prt \to X\prt$, where $\mu$ takes any $(i,u)$ with $i : \I$ and $u : \ms ti \to X\prt$ first to $(j,x)$, where $j$ is the dependent sum
\[ j := \sum_{w:\ms ti} (uw)_0, \]
and $x : \ms tj \to X$ is the partial element such that for $w : \ms ti$ and $v : (uw)_0$
\[ x(w,v) := (uw)_1(v). \]

\begin{example}
  By definition, it is easy to see that
  \[ 1\prt = \sum_{i:\I}\ms ti = \I. \]
\end{example}

For synthetic domain theory, the object of particular importance is the lift of the type of open propositions $\I$ itself. In fact, the lifting of any stably quasi-coherent $\I$-algebra can be computed fairely explicitly:

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:liftingofalgebra}
  If $A$ is stably quasi-coherent, then we have
  \[ A\prt = \scomp{i : \I, a : A}{a \le i}. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Note for any $i : \I$, the quotient $A/i$ is again quasi-coherent. Now notice that we do have
  \[ A/i = A \otimes \I/i. \]
  By Corollary~\ref{cor:tensorasspace} and quasi-coherence of $A/i$, 
  \[ A/i = A \otimes \I/i = A^{\spec \I/i} = A^{\ms ti}. \]
  This way, it follows that 
  \[ A\prt = \sum_{i:\I}A^{\ms ti} = \sum_{i:\I}A/i = \scomp{i : \I, a : A}{a \le i}. \qedhere \]
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[SQCI]
  For the interval $\I$, $\I\prt = \Delta^2$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  By Lemma~\ref{lem:liftingofalgebra}, 
  \[ \I\prt = \scomp{i,j : \I}{i \ge j} = \Delta^2. \]
  The second equivalence again uses the fact that $\T$ is propositional.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  One interesting thing to notice here is that, though $\I\prt$ by computation is a dependent sum of algebras, it is naturally equivalent to a \emph{spectrum}, which is a geometric object. In some sense the source is the assumption that $\T$ is propositional, which allows us to identify the algebraic object $\I/i$ as a subset $\scomp{j : \I}{j \le i}$.
\end{remark}


More generally, for domain theoretic applications we would want to compute the liftings of the simplices introduced as spectrums in Example~\ref{exm:simplicesaffine}. It is first of all easy to see that the lifting of any affine space is also straight forward to compute by duality:

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:liftofaffine}
  If $X = \spec A$ is affine, then the lifting of $X$ is given by
  \[ X\prt = \sum_{i:\I}\I\alg(A,\I/i). \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By Proposition~\ref{prop:duality}, since $X = \spec A$ is affine,
  \[ X\prt = \sum_{i:\I}X^{\ms ti} = \sum_{i:\I}\spec A^{\spec \I/i} = \sum_{i:\I}\I\alg(A,\I/i). \qedhere \]
\end{proof}

Thus, motivated by domain theory, we find ourselves naturally move towards the following axiomatisation:

\begin{axiom}[SQCF]
  All finitely generated free $\I$-algebras, i.e. $\I[n]$ for $n : \N$, are stably quasi-coherent.
\end{axiom}

Equivalently, (SQCF) says that any finitely presented $\I$-algebra is (stably) quasi-coherent, where an $\I$-algebra is finitely presented if it is merely of the form $\I[n]/s=t$ with $s,t : m \to \I[n]$ for some finite $n,m$.

Of course, (SQCF) implies (SQCI) when taking $n$ to be 0. Furthermore, (SQCF) implies that the simplices $\Delta^n$ are now (stably) affine as well. This way, we can indeed compute their lifts:

\begin{lemma}[SQCF]
  For any $n : \N$, we have
  \[ \Delta^n\prt = \Delta^{n+1}. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By Lemma~\ref{lem:liftofaffine}, for the affine space $\Delta^n = \spec\I[n]/i_1 \ge \cdots \ge i_n$,
  \begin{align*}
    \Delta^n\prt 
    &= \sum_{i:\I}\I\alg(\I[n]/i_1\ge\cdots\ge i_n,\I/i) \\
    &= \scomp{i,i_1,\cdots,i_n:\I}{i \ge i_1 \ge \cdots \ge i_n} \\
    &= \Delta^{n+1}
  \end{align*}
  The second equality again uses the fact that $\T$ is propositional.
\end{proof}

In particular, from a geometric perspective, the unit
\[ \eta : \Delta^n \inj \Delta^n\prt = \Delta^{n+1} \]
takes $i_1 \ge \cdots \ge i_n$ in $\Delta^n$ to $1 \ge i_1 \ge \cdots \ge i_n$ in $\Delta^{n+1}$. 

\section{Distributive lattice and locality}\label{sec:locality}

One important finitary axiom for synthetic domain theory is the \emph{Phoa's principle}, which as an observation of~\cite{gratzer2024directed} is a consequence of the quasi-coherence principle for distributive lattices. Thus, we now work in the theory $\T$ of distributive lattices, or more generally the theory of $D$-algebra for some distributive lattice $D$.

In this case, $\I$ also has a minimal element $0$. Notice that the constant $0$ also induces a predicate on $\I$,
\[ \ms f : \I \to \pp, \]
which takes any $i : \I$ to $i = 0$. Notice that the theory of distributive lattices also satisfies the \emph{dual} property of being propositional. Hence, previous developments would also hold when we exchange $1$ for $0$ and $\wedge$ for $\vee$. 

For instance, the same proof as in Lemma~\ref{lem:intconserve} also implies the following:

\begin{corollary}[SQCI]
  $\ms f : \I \to \pp$ is an embedding.
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}\label{rem:prefield}
  Notice that this does \emph{not} hold for the theory of Heyting algebras, since the map $a \vee - : A \to A/a = 0$ is \emph{not} a quotient morphism for $A$ a Heyting algebra. Hence, the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:intconserve} does not apply. For instance, under (SQCI), the affine space $\I/i=0$ in this case is equivalent to $\I/\neg i$. It then follows by Lemma~\ref{lem:intconserve} that $\ms fi = \ms fj$ iff $\neg i = \neg j$, which not necessarily implies $i = j$.
\end{remark}

We will now call propositions in the image of $\ms f$ \emph{closed}, and a subtype classified by $\ms f$ a \emph{closed subtype}. Completely similar to the previous Lemma~\ref{lem:openofaffinegivesalgebra}, closed subtypes of affine spaces are again of the following form:

\begin{corollary}[SQCI]\label{cor:closedaffinealgebra}
  If $X = \spec A$ is affine, then closed subtypes of $X$ are all of the form
  \[ C_a := \scomp{x : X}{\ms f(xa)} = \spec a/A, \]
  for some $a:A$. If $X$ is stably affine, then so is $C_a$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}[SQCI]
  $\ms f$ forms a dominance.
\end{corollary}

There is an accompanying \emph{colifting} monad $(-)\cprt$, defined by
\[ X\cprt := \sum_{i:\I} X^{\ms fi}. \]
And similarly, under (SQCF), we can explicitly compute the colifting of the simplices $\Delta^n$,
\[ \Delta^n\cprt = \Delta^{n+1}, \]
where now the unit $\eta : \Delta^n \inj \Delta^n\cprt = \Delta^{n+1}$ takes a sequence $i_1 \ge \cdots \ge i_n$ to $i_1 \ge \cdots \ge i_n \ge 0$ in $\Delta^{n+1}$. To distinguish the two inclusions $\Delta^n \inj \Delta^n\prt = \Delta^{n+1}$ and $\Delta^n \inj \Delta^{n}\cprt = \Delta^{n+1}$, we will denote the former as $\eta\prt$ and the latter as $\eta\cprt$.

To model divergent computation, we would like the dominance $\I$ to be closed under falsum. Hence, we may further introduce the following minimal amount of non-triviality:

\begin{axiom}[NT]\label{ax:nt}
  For $\I$, $0 \neq 1$.
\end{axiom}

\begin{remark}
  The above axiom semantically corresponds to working with certain subtopoi of the classifying topos $\Set[\T]$. For instance, the minimal topology on the underlying site $\mmod\T\fp$ we might choose for (NT) to hold is to assert that the trivial $\T$-model is covered by the empty sieve. Since the trivial $\T$-model is a strict terminal object, this topology will be subcanonical, thus (SQCF) still holds.
\end{remark}

Let us first observe some elementary consequence of (NT). For instance, the lifting monad $(-)\prt$ defined in Section~\ref{sec:lifting} is now also pointed, where for any $X$ we can define
\[ \bot := (0,?) : X\prt, \]
where $? : \ms t0 = \emp \to X$ is the unique map from $\emp$.

As another consequence, now $\emp = \ms t0$ is affine, in fact both an open and closed proposition. For any $\I$-algebra $A$, we say $A$ is \emph{trivial} if it is equivalent to the trivial $\I$-algebra, which we denote as $0$. Equivalently, this is saying that $0 = 1$ in $A$. In the case of (NT), we have the following weak form of nullstellensatz:

\begin{lemma}[NT]\label{lem:nulls}
  For any affine $X = \spec A$, $X = \emp$ iff $A$ is trivial.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By assumption, $A = \I^{\spec A} = \I^\emp = 0$. 
\end{proof}

As a simple application of the above weak nullstellensatz, $\I$ is almost a field in the following sense:

\begin{corollary}[NT, SQCI]\label{cor:field}
  For any $i : \I$ 
  \[ \neg \ms ti \eq \ms fi, \quad \neg\ms fi \eq \ms ti. \]
  In particular, the embedding $2 \inj \I$ induced by $0,1$ is $\neg\neg$-dense,
  \[ \fa i\I \dneg(\ms ti \vee \ms fi). \]
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  If $\ms fi$ then $\neg\ms ti$ by (NT). On the other hand, by the conservativity result in Lemma~\ref{lem:intconserve} and (NT), if $i \neq 1$ then $i = 0$ since $0 \neq 1$. The dual case is completely similar. 
\end{proof}

This allows us to observe that the open and closed propositions are exactly complementary to each other:

\begin{corollary}[NT, SQCI]\label{cor:opendnegclose}
  For any proposition $p$, $p$ is open iff $\neg p$ is closed and vice versa. Furthermore, open and closed propositions are $\dneg$-stable.
\end{corollary}

As another consequence, we will see that $\I$ is \emph{internally connected}. To show this, we consider the following notion of \emph{specialisation order}:

\begin{definition}
  The \emph{specialisation order} on a type $X$ is defined as follows:
  \[ x \preceq y := \fa{U}{X\to\I} U(x) \le U(y). \]
\end{definition}

By definition, the specialisation order is reflexive and transitive. As already observed in \emph{loc. cit.}, one important property of the specialisation order is that \emph{every} map is monotone w.r.t. this order:

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:anymapmonotoneintriscorder}
  For $f : X \to Y$, $x \preceq y$ in $X$ implies $fx \preceq fy$ in $Y$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  This simply follows from compositionality of functions.
\end{proof}

For $X = \spec A$ an affine space, $\I^X = A$, which means for any $x,y : X$,
\[ x \preceq y \eq \fa aA xa \le ya. \]
In other words, the order $\preceq$ on an affine space is the point-wise order in $X = \I\alg(A,\I)$. In particular, we have:

\begin{lemma}[SQCF]
  The specialisation order on $\I^n$ is point-wise for $n : \N$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Note that $\I^n = \spec \I[n]$. Since all variables are in particular polynomials, the specialisation order on $\I^n$ will be point-wise.
\end{proof}

Furthermore, subspaces of affine spaces induced by quotients inherits the specialisation order:

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:orderonaffine}
  Let $A,B$ be quasi-coherent and $A \surj B$ a surjection of $\I$-algebras. Then for the inclusion $\spec B \hook \spec A$, for any $x,y : \spec B$ we have $x \preceq y$ in $\spec B$ iff $x \preceq y$ in $\spec A$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By monotonicity in Lemma~\ref{lem:anymapmonotoneintriscorder}, it suffices to show for $x,y : \spec B$, if $x \preceq y$ in $\spec A$, then $x \preceq y$ in $\spec B$. However, this follows from the fact that $\I$ is weakly orthogonal to the inclusion $\spec B \hook \spec A$,
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \spec B \ar[d, hook] \ar[r, "b"] & \I \\ 
    \spec A \ar[ur, dashed, "\exists a"'] 
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  because by quasi-coherence $\I^{\spec A} = A \surj B = \I^{\spec B}$ is a surjection.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[SQCF]\label{cor:syntheticorderinterval}
  The specialisation order on simplices $\Delta^n$ and $\Delta_n$ are also point-wise.
\end{corollary}

We can also classify the specialisation order on discrete sets, i.e. sets with decidable equality:

\begin{lemma}[NT, SQCF]\label{lem:discretephoa}
  If $M$ is a discrete set, then the specialisation order on $M$ is discrete, in the sense that for $n,m : M$,
  \[ n \preceq m \to n = m. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $n \preceq m$. If $n \neq m$, we can construct a map $f : M \to \I$ with $f(n) = 1$ and $f(m) = 0$, contradictory to $n \preceq m$. Hence, $n = m$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[NT, SQCF]\label{cor:connectedpreservediscrete}
  For any type $X$ whose specialisation order is connected, the map $M \to M^X$ is an equivalence for a discrete set $M$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  When $X$ is merely inhabited, the map $M \to M^X$ is always an embedding, thus it suffices to show it is surjective. Suppose we have $f : X \to M$. Since $X$ is connected, there merely exists $x:X$, and for any $y:X$, by monotonicity in Lemma~\ref{lem:anymapmonotoneintriscorder} and by Lemma~\ref{lem:discretephoa} $f(x) = f(y)$. Hence, $f$ is the constant function on $x$, which implies $M \to M^X$ is an equivalence.
\end{proof}

This is in particularly true for cubes $\I^n$ and simplices $\Delta^n,\Delta_n$, since their specialisation order has a top and bottom element. To further determine the space $2^X$ for an arbitrary affine space $X$, we introduce a further locality axiom:

\begin{axiom}[L]
  $\I$ is local, i.e. $0 \neq 1$ and $\ms t(i\vee j) \eq \ms ti \vee \ms tj$ for all $i,j : \I$.
\end{axiom}

(L) implies that the dominance $\I$ is closed under finite disjunction, and that open subtypes are closed under finite unions. For open subsets of affine spaces this can be described more clearly:

\begin{lemma}[L, SQCI]
  If $X = \spec A$ is affine, then $D_0 = \emp$, and for any $a,b : A$, $D_a \cup D_b = D_{a\vee b}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  For any $D_0 = \emp$ follows from (NT). For any $x:X$,
  \[ (D_a \cup D_b) (x) = \ms t(xa) \vee \ms t(xb) = \ms t(x(a \vee b)) = D_{a\vee b}(x). \qedhere \]
\end{proof}

Using this characterisation, we can classify the space $2^X$ for any affine space $X$:

\begin{lemma}[L]\label{lem:decompcomplement}
  If $X = \spec A$ is stably affine, then $2^X$ is equivalent to the set of complemented elements in $A$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Notice that a map $X \to 2 \to \I$ corresponds to an open subset of $X$, which is of the form $D_a$ for some $a:A$. By swapping $\neg : 2 \to 2$, we get another open subset $D_b$ with $D_a \cap D_b = \emp$ and $D_a \cup D_b = X$. Now this imparticular means that
  \[ D_a \cap D_b = D_{a \wedge b} = \emp, \quad D_a \cup D_b = D_{a\vee b} = X, \]
  which by Lemma~\ref{lem:completeness} $a \wedge b = 0$ and $a \vee b = 1$. 
\end{proof}

As a consequence, we may conclude the following:

\begin{corollary}[L, SQCI]
  For any $i : \I$, if $i$ has a complement, then $\ms ti \vee \ms fi$. In particular, $\I$ is not Boolean.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Since $2 = 2^1$ where $1 = \spec \I$, Lemma~\ref{lem:decompcomplement} then implies that the only complemented element in $\I$ are $0,1$. Now if $\I$ is Boolean, this implies that $\I = 2$, which contradicts Corollary~\ref{cor:connectedpreservediscrete}.
\end{proof}

However, not all affine spaces will be internally connected:

\begin{example}
  Consider the algebra classifying complemented elements,
  \[ A := \I[x,y]/x\vee y = 1,x \wedge y = 0. \]
  The two variables $x,y$ are complemented to each other in the above algebra, hence under (L) and (SQCF) by Lemma~\ref{lem:decompcomplement} we know $\spec A$ can be decomposed into a non-trivial coproduct,
  \[ \spec A = D_x + D_y, \]
  Furthermore, we observe that 
  \[ D_x = \spec(\I[x,y]/x \vee y = 1,x \wedge y = 0,x =1) = \spec \I = 1, \]
  and similarly for $D_y$. Hence, now we have $\spec A = 2$, and now $2$ is \emph{affine}.
\end{example}

As another example of an affine space (L) allows us to define:

\begin{example}\label{exm:hornaffine}
  Consider the right outer horn $\Lambda^2_2$ as a pushout,
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      1 \ar[d, "1"'] \ar[r, "1"] & \I \ar[d] \\
      \I \ar[r] & \Lambda^2_2
      \arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125, rotate=180}, draw=none, from=2-2, to=1-1]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  By viewing $\Lambda^2_2$ as a subspace of $\I^2$, we may identify it as follows,
  \[ \Lambda^2_2 = \scomp{i,j : \I}{\ms ti \vee \ms tj}. \]
  Assuming (L), $\ms ti \vee \ms tj = \ms t(i\vee j)$, it follows that 
  \[ \Lambda^2_2 = \spec \I[i,j]/i \vee j. \]
\end{example}

Dually, one can assume the colocality:

\begin{axiom}[cL]
  $\I$ is colocal, i.e. $0 \neq 1$ and $\ms f(i \wedge j) \eq \ms fi \vee \ms fj$ for all $i,j : \I$.
\end{axiom}

Similalry to Example~\ref{exm:hornaffine}, this allows to define the left ourter horn $\Lambda^2_0$ as an affine space. Of course we can combine (L) and (cL), which gives us both outer horns.

A stronger localicy axiom than (L) and (cL) is the simplicial axiom:

\begin{axiom}[SL]
  $\I$ is \emph{linear}, i.e. $0 \neq 1$ and for all $i,j : \I$, $i \vee j \vee j \le i$.
\end{axiom}

The linearity axiom is saying that $\Delta^2,\Delta_2$ covers the square,
\[ \Delta^2 \cup \Delta_2 = \I^2. \]
An even stronger locality axiom states that the simplicial structure is truncated to level 1:

\begin{axiom}[1T]
  $\I$ is \emph{1-truncated}, i.e. $0 \neq 1$ and for $i,j : \I$, $i \le j$ iff $\ms fi \vee \ms tj \vee i = j$.
\end{axiom}

The above exactly says that the 2-simplice $\Delta_2$ is covered by its three edges, which means that $\partial\Delta_2 = \Delta_2$.

\section{Phoa's principle}\label{sec:intposet}

Given the specialisation order on $X$, one natural question is its relation with the function space $X^\I$: 

\begin{definition}\label{def:phoa}
  We say a type $X$ is \emph{Phoa}, if 
  \[ \pair{\ev_0,\ev_1} : X^\I \to \operatorname{\preceq} \]
  is an equivalence over $X \times X$, and $\preceq$ is anti-symmetric on $X$, in the sense that for $x,y :X$,
  \[ x = y \to x \preceq y \wedge y \preceq x \]
  is an equivalence. In particular, $X$ will be a set.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  In~\cite{PhoaWesleyKym-Son1991DtiR}, a type $X$ is called \emph{linked} if $X^\I \to \operatorname{\preceq}$ is a surjection.
\end{remark}

Notice that assuming (SQCF), the specialisation order on $\I$ coincides with its usual order, thus by monotonicity for any $f : \I \to X$ we indeed have $f(0) \preceq f(1)$, which means the above notion is well-defined.

\begin{example}
  For instance, assuming (NT) and (SQCF), Lemma~\ref{lem:discretephoa} and Corollary~\ref{cor:connectedpreservediscrete} implies all discrete sets will be Phoa.
\end{example}

The true strength of working with distributive lattices, besides the symmetry between $1,\wedge$ and $0,\vee$, is the following fact:

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:phoaaffine}
  Any affine space $X$ will be Phoa.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  For any affine space $X$ we have 
  \[ X^\I = \I\alg(A,\I[i]). \]
  Hence it suffices to show that the pair of evaluation maps
  \[ \pair{\ev_0,\ev_1} : \I[i] \to \I \times \I \]
  classifies the order on $\I$. This follows from a normal form result of polynomials for distributive lattices, i.e. any polynomial $p$ is of the form 
  \[ p = p(0) \vee x \wedge p(1). \]
  See e.g.~\cite[Thm. 10.11]{lausch2000algebra}. This way, a map $\I \to X$ is exactly described as two points $x,y : X$ such that $\fa aA xa \le ya$, which coincides with $x \preceq y$. Furthermore, this order is anti-symmetric by definition.
\end{proof}

In the literature, the above statement restricted to $\I$ is usually denoted as the \emph{Phoa's principle}. From Theorem~\ref{thm:phoaaffine}, this property can be generalised to all affine spaces.

\begin{remark}
  Crucially, we emphasis that the above proof does \emph{not} in fact rely on the affineness of the interval $\I$ itself. Rather, it is purely the consequence of the fact that for any distributive lattice $A$, the free algebra $A[i]$ is equivalent to the order on $A$. This is a perfect example of how an algebraic property of a theory has a non-trivial effect on the internal logic of its classifying topos.
\end{remark}

The class of Phoa types is indeed \emph{reflective}:

\begin{proposition}[SQCF]\label{prop:phoaexponential}
  The specialisation order on a limit of Phoa types is point-wise. Furthermore, Phoa types are reflective, with the reflector of $X$ being the largest sub Phoa type of $\I^{\I^X}$ containing $X$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  See~\cite[Sec. 5.4]{PhoaWesleyKym-Son1991DtiR}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[SQCF]
  For a quasi-coherent $\I$-algebra $A$, the specialisation order is its usual order, and it is Phoa.
\end{corollary}

At the end of this section, we describe another interesting perspective arising from the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:phoaaffine}. We have seen that the dualising object $\I$ has a double role: It is both an algebra and a spectrum. The proof of Phoa's principle gives us many more such examples. For instance, $\I[i]$ classifies the order on $\I$, which by definition is the spectrum $\Delta_2$. In fact, \emph{all} the simplices in this case have an algebraic description:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:simplicesasalgebra}
  For any $n : \N$ and $\I$-algebra $A$, for any $a_0 \ge \cdots \ge a_n$ in $A$, define a polynomial in $A[i_1,\cdots,i_n]$ as follows,
  \[ a_0 \wedge i_1 \vee a_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge i_n \vee a_n. \]
  This is well-defined in the quotient $A[n]/i_1 \le \cdots \le i_n$, in the sense that the value does not depend on how one arranges parenthesis. In fact this gives us an equivalence
  \[ \Delta[A]^{n+1} = A[n]/i_1 \le \cdots \le i_n, \]
  where we write $\Delta[A]^{n+1}$ as $\scomp{a_0,\cdots,a_n : A}{a_0 \ge \cdots \ge a_n}$. Completely similarly, we have an equivalence
  \[ \Delta[A]_{n+1} = A[n]/i_1 \ge \cdots \ge i_n. \]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  This again follows from a normal form result on algebras of the form $A[n]/i_1 \le \cdots \le i_n$, which is a consequence of the general normal form for polynomials on distributive lattices; see~\cite[Thm. 10.21]{lausch2000algebra}.
\end{proof}

Now we can identify the simplices $\Delta^n$ as a finitely presented $\I$-algebra as shown above. Under such equivalences, the inclusion $\eta\prt$ simply corresponds to the canonical inclusion as shown below,
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \Delta^{n+1} \ar[r, tail, "\eta\prt"] \ar[d, "\simeq"'] & \Delta^{n+2}  \ar[d, "\simeq"] \\ 
    \I[n]/i_1 \le \cdots \le i_n \ar[r, tail] & \I[n\!+\!1]/i_0 \le \cdots \le i_{n} 
  \end{tikzcd}
\]

\section{Infinitay domain theory}\label{sec:infdomain}

Untill this point, we have seen that all the finitary axioms for synthetic domain theory is a consequence of (SQCF) for a theory of distributive algebra, with potentially the assumption of (NT).

There is one final crucial infinitary axiom of synthetic domain theory. From the observation in~\cite{hyland2006first,JIBLADZE1997185}, we can define internally in type theory the initial algebra and final coalgebra for the lifting functor $(-)\prt$, which we denote as $\omega$ and $\ov\omega$, respectively. There is a canonical inclusion $\omega \inj \ov\omega$, and the final axiom for synthetic domain theory states that the interval $\I$ is \emph{complete}, in the sense that the induced map $\I^{\ov\omega} \to \I^\omega$ is an \emph{equivalence}. The goal of this section is to explain that, this completeness axiom can also be realised as a consequence of quasi-coherence.

Since $(-)\prt$ by construction preserves all connected limits, the final coalgebra $\ov\omega$ can be easily characterised as a limit. As shown in~\cite{hyland2006first}, it can be identified as the object of infinite descending sequences in $\I$,
\[ \ov\omega := \scomp{i : \N \to \I}{\fa n\N i_n \ge i_{n+1}}, \]
which can be viewed as the following sequential limit,
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  \cdots \ar[r] & \Delta^2 \ar[r, "!\prt"] & \I \ar[r, "!"] & 1
\end{tikzcd}
\]
where the transition map $\Delta^{n+1} \to \Delta^n$ takes the sequence $i_0 \ge \cdots \ge i_n$ to the final segment $i_1 \ge \cdots \ge i_n$. 

According to the above description, $\ov\omega$ is in fact a \emph{spectrum},
\[ \ov\omega = \spec(\I[\N]/\forall n.\, i_n \ge i_{n+1}). \]
However, the corresponding algebra is no longer finitely presented, but countably presented. By a countably presented, or c.p. in short, $\I$-algebra, we mean an $\I$-algebra of the form $\I[I]/s=t$ for some \emph{decidable} subsets $I,J$ of $\N$ with $s,t : J \to \I[I]$. In particular, all finitely presented $\I$-algebra will also be countably presented. Motivated by the above characterisation of $\ov\omega$, we naturally consider the following stronger quasi-coherence principle:

\begin{axiom}[SQCC]
  All c.p. $\I$-algebras are (stably) quasi-coherent.
\end{axiom}

\begin{remark}
  The quasi-coherence principle for countably presented algebras is investigated in~\cite{cherubini2024foundation}. Just like the finitary version (SQCF), which is true in the classifying topos $\Set[\T] = [\mmod\T\fp,\Set]$, the countable version (SQCC) will be valid in a larger presheaf topos $[\mmod\T\cp,\Set]$, or any subtopos induced by a subcanonical topology. For instance, the semantics of~\cite{cherubini2024foundation} is based on the topos of light condensed sets introduced by Clausen and Scholze, which is a subtopos of $[\mmod{\mbb B}\cp,\Set]$.
\end{remark}

There are many immediate consequences of (SQCC). For instance, the description of the specialisation order for affine spaces in Lemma~\ref{lem:orderonaffine} now applies to $\ov\omega$ as well, which implies it has both a top and bottom element. Then Corollary~\ref{cor:connectedpreservediscrete} now also applies to $\ov\omega$, and $M \to M^{\ov\omega}$ is an equivalence for any discrete set $M$. 

There are more logical consequences of (SQCC). Let us observe that it implies the following form of Markov principle:

\begin{lemma}[NT, SQCC]\label{lem:markov}
  For any $i : \ov\omega$, we have
  \[ \neg\fa{n}{\N}\ms ti_n \to \ex n\N\ms fi_n. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $i : \ov\omega$. Notice that similar to Lemma~\ref{lem:openpropaffine}, the proposition $\fa n\N \ms ti_n$ by construction is the following affine space, 
  \[ \spec\I/i = \I\alg(\I/i,\I) = \fa n\N \ms ti_n, \]
  where we have abbreviated the c.p. $\I$-algebra $\I/\forall k.\, i_k = 1$ as $\I/i$. Now if we have $\neg\fa n\N \ms ti_n$, then $\spec\I/i = \emp$ which implies $\I/i$ is trivial by Lemma~\ref{lem:nulls}. But this algebra is trivial iff there merely exists $n : \N$ that $\ms fi_n$ holds, thus $\ex n\N \ms fi_n$.
\end{proof}

Now let us consider the initial algebra $\omega$ for the lifting functor. It is shown in~\cite{JIBLADZE1997185} that we can identify $\omega \inj \ov\omega$ as the following subset,
\[ \omega := \scomp{i : \ov\omega}{\fa\phi{\pp} (\fa n{\N} (\ms ti_n \to \phi) \to \phi) \to \phi}. \]
For another proof, see e.g.~\cite{VANOOSTEN2000233}. In the presence of the Markov principle above, this description can be drastically simplified:

\begin{lemma}[NT, SQCC]\label{lem:omegacolimit}
  $\omega$ is equivalent to the following subset of $\ov\omega$,
  \[ \omega = \scomp{i : \ov\omega}{\ex n{\N} \ms fi_n}. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $i : \ov\omega$. It suffices to show that
  \[ \prth{\fa\phi{\pp} (\fa n{\N} (\ms ti_n \to \phi) \to \phi) \to \phi} \to \ex{n}\N \ms fi_n, \]
  We can take $\phi$ to be $\emp$. By assumption we have $\neg\fa n\N \neg\neg\ms ti_n$, which by Corollary~\ref{cor:opendnegclose} is equivalent to $\neg\fa n\N \ms ti_n$. Then Lemma~\ref{lem:markov} implies this is $\ex n\N \ms fi_n$.
\end{proof}

By~\cite[Cor. 1.10]{VANOOSTEN2000233}, the above result exactly means that $\omega$ is indeed the internal colimit of the following sequence,
\[ 
\begin{tikzcd}
  \emp \ar[r, "?"] & 1 \ar[r, "?\prt = \eta\cprt"] & \I \ar[r, "\eta\cprt"] & \Delta^2 \ar[r] & \cdots
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Using this, we can now show the most important infinitary axiom for synthetic domain theory:

\begin{theorem}[NT, SQCC]\label{thm:complete}
  The canonical map $\I^{\ov\omega} \to \I^\omega$ is an equivalence.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Since $\ov\omega$ is now affine, we have
  \[ \I^{\ov\omega} = \I[\N]/\forall n.\,i_n\ge i_{n+1}. \]
  On the other hand, since $\omega$ is internally the colimit of $\Delta^n$, we have
  \[ \I^\omega = \lt_{n:\N}\I^{\Delta^n} = \lt_{n:\N} \I[n]/i_1 \ge \cdots \ge i_n. \]
  Note that the transition maps induced by $\eta\cprt : \Delta^n \to \Delta^{n+1}$ under quasi-coherence gives us the following maps on algebras:
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \I^{\Delta^{n+1}} \ar[r, "\I^{\eta\cprt}"] & \I^{\Delta^n} \\ 
    \I[n\!+\!1]/i_1 \ge \cdots \ge i_{n+1} \ar[u, "\simeq"] \ar[r, "i_{n+1} \mapsto 0"'] & \I[n]/i_1 \ge \cdots \ge i_n \ar[u, "\simeq"']
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  Now taking the limit of the above sequence of algebras gives us
  \[ \lt_{n:\N}\I[n]/i_1 \ge \cdots \ge i_n = \I[\N]/\forall n.\,i_n \ge i_{n+1} = \I^{\ov\omega}. \]
  This shows that $\I^{\omega} = \I^{\ov\omega}$.
\end{proof}

Finally, at the end of this section, we observe that the algebraic description of the simplices given at the end of Section~\ref{sec:intposet} can be extended to the above infinitary case:

\begin{corollary}[NT, SQCC]
  $\I^{\ov\omega} = \I[\N]/\forall n.\, i_n \ge i_{n+1}$ is equivalent to $\Delta_\infty$, 
  \[ \Delta_\infty := \scomp{i : \N \to \I}{\fa n\N i_n \le i_{n+1}}. \]
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Following the discussion at the end of Section~\ref{sec:intposet}, we have the following equivalences,
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      \Delta_{n+1} \ar[r, tail, "\eta\cprt"] \ar[d, "\simeq"'] & \Delta_{n+2}  \ar[d, "\simeq"] \\ 
      \I[n]/i_1 \ge \cdots \ge i_n \ar[r, tail] & \I[n\!+\!1]/i_1 \ge \cdots \ge i_{n+1} 
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  Then taking the sequential colimit on both sides, we get an equivalence
  \[ \Delta_{\infty} = \I[\N]/\forall n.\, i_n \ge i_{n+1}. \qedhere \]
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[NT, SQCC]
  $\omega$ is Phoa.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Since $\ov\omega$ is affine, by Theorem~\ref{thm:phoaaffine} it is Phoa. Now by Theorem~\ref{thm:complete}, the specialisation order on $\omega$ will be induced from the one on $\ov\omega$, hence it will be Phoa.
\end{proof}

% \section{specialisation posets continued}\label{sec:synposet}

% The aim of this section is to first show that specialisation posets are exactly the \emph{replete objects} in the sense of~\cite{hyland2006first}, and that they satisfy some closure properties under certain colimits.

% We say a type $X$ is \emph{$f$-local} if $X^f$ is an equivalence. Dually, we also say $f$ is \emph{$X$-trivial}.

% \begin{definition}
%   A type $X$ is \emph{replete}, if it is $f$-local for all $\I$-trivial maps $f$.
% \end{definition}

% Though this is a very big orthogonality class, it is shown in~\cite{hyland2006first} that it is \emph{reflective}, and the reflector is the image of the canonical map $X \to \I^{\I^X}$.

% \begin{lemma}[SQCF]
%   $X$ is replete iff its specialisation order is anti-symmetric.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
%   For any $x,y : X$, since $\I^{\I^X}$ is a set, they are equal in $\I^{\I^X}$ iff
%   \[ \fa U{X \to \I} Ux = Uy, \]
%   which is equivalent to $x \preceq y \wedge y \preceq x$. Hence, $X \to \I^{\I^X}$ is an embedding iff $x = y \to x \preceq y \wedge y \preceq x$ is an equivalence, which exactly means the specialisation order on $X$ is anti-symmetric.
% \end{proof}

% \begin{lemma}\label{lem:affspspecialisationposet}
%   All affine spaces are specialisation posets.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
%   As shown in Theorem~\ref{thm:phoaaffine}, any affine space $X = \spec A$ is Phoa, and the specialisation order on $X$ is induced by the point-wise order on $\I\alg(A,\I)$, which is anti-symmetric.
% \end{proof}

% \begin{lemma}[SQCF]\label{lem:qcalgebraintposet}
%   All quasi-coherent $\I$-algebras are specialisation posets.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
%   Again, by Theorem~\ref{them:phoaalgebra}, a quasi-coherent algebra $A$ is Phoa, and the specialisation order coincides with the order on $A$.
% \end{proof}

% specialisation posets satisfy the closure properties of an orthogonality class:

% \begin{lemma}[SQCF]
%   The specialisation order on limits of specialisation posets is point-wise, and are again specialisation posets. They in fact form an exponential ideal.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
%   Suppose we have a limit $\lt_{r:I}X_r$ of specialisation posets. Given $(x_r)_{r:I}$ and $(y_r)_{r:I}$ in the limit, by monotonicity in Lemma~\ref{lem:anymapmonotoneintriscorder}, if $(x_r)_{r:I} \preceq (y_r)_{r:I}$, then the projection maps imply that $x_r \preceq y_r$ for all $r:I$. On the other hand, if $x_r \preceq y_r$ for all $r:I$, then since each $X_r$ is Phoa, we get a unique map $f_r : \I \to X_r$. We then need to show that this gives us $(f_r)_{r:I} : \I \to X_r$. This indeed follows from the Phoa's principle on each $X_r$. Hence, the order on the limit is again point-wise, and the limit is Phoa. Being an exponential ideal follows from~\ref{prop:phoaexponential}.
% \end{proof}

% Perhaps more surprisingly, specialisation posets will also be closed under various colimit constructions. To show this, we observe the following result:

% \begin{lemma}[NT, SQCF]
%   Let $X$ be a type with connected specialisation order. $(-)^X$ preserves dependent sums over discrete sets.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
%   Suppose we have a discrete set $M$ and a family $P$ of types over $M$. Consider the canonical map
%   \[ \sum_{m:M} P_m^X \to \prth{\sum_{m:M}P_m}^X. \]
%   Since $X$ is connected, there merely is $x : X$. For any $f : X \to \sum_{m:M}P_m$, by Corollary~\ref{cor:connectedpreservediscrete}, $\pi_Mf(y) = \pi_Mf(x)$ for all $y : X$, thus $f$ factors through $P_m^X$, which then implies the fibres of the above map is contractible since $M$ is a discrete set.
% \end{proof}

% \begin{corollary}[NT, SQCF]
%   specialisation posets are closed under dependent sums over discrete sets.
% \end{corollary}

% \begin{definition}\label{def:projective}
%   A type $X$ is \emph{projective}, if for any family $P$ of sets
%   \[ \prod_{x:X}\pss{P_x} \to \pss{\prod_{x:X}P_x}. \]
% \end{definition}

% \begin{lemma}[NT, SQCF]
%   Let $X$ be a projective type with connected specialisation order. $(-)^X$ preserves sequential colimits.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
%   For a family of sets $Y_n$ indexed by $\N$ with maps $f_n : Y_n \to Y_{n+1}$, recall from~\cite{10.1145/3373718.3394801} the colimit $\ct_{n:\N}Y_n$ is again a set, which is constructed as in usual set theory. Consider the canonical map
%   \[ \ct_{n:\N}Y_n^X \to \prth{\ct_{n:\N}Y_n}^X. \]
%   To show this is injective, it suffices to assume we have two elements $[(n,y)]$ and $[(m,z)]$. If they agree in the target, which means
%   \[ \fa xX \ex l\N f_{ln}(yx) = f_{lm}(zx). \]
%   By projectivity of $X$, we merely have a section $l : X \to \N$. By Corollary~\ref{cor:connectedpreservediscrete}, this section is indeed constant at $l = l(x)$ for the mere element $x:X$. It then follows that $[(n,y)] = [(m,z)]$.

%   On the other hand, by projectivitity the above map is also surjective, since if we have $f : X \to \ct_{n:\N}Y_n$, then we have
%   \[ \fa xX \ex n\N\ex{y}{Y_n} fx = [(i,y)]. \]
%   By projectivity again, we merely have a section $X \to \N$, which is again constant by Corollary~\ref{cor:connectedpreservediscrete}. Thus we merely get a preimage.
% \end{proof}

% \begin{corollary}[NT, SQCF]\label{cor:intposetseqcolimit}
%   Assuming $\I$ is projective, specialisation posets are closed under sequential colimits.
% \end{corollary}

% \begin{remark}
%   This is the first place in this work where we require a form of projectivity of $\I$. $\I$ will indeed be projective, in fact \emph{$\infty$-projective} in the sense that Definition~\ref{def:projective} not only applies to sets but arbitrary types, in all the models we care about.
% \end{remark}

% \begin{example}
%   Notice that as we have shown in Section~\ref{sec:infdomain} that, under (NT) and (SQCC), $\omega$ is the colimit of simplices $\Delta_n$. By Corollary~\ref{cor:intposetseqcolimit}, assuming $\I$ is projective, $\omega$ will also be a specialisation poset.
% \end{example}

% \section{Lifting continued}

% We would like to furthermore show that specialisation posets are closed under lifting. To this end, we introduce a stronger locality axiom:

% \begin{axiom}[L]
%   $\I$ is local, i.e. $0 \neq 1$ and $\ms t(i\vee j) \eq \ms ti \vee \ms tj$ for all $i,j : \I$.
% \end{axiom}

% We observe some elementary consequences of (L):

% \begin{lemma}[L, SQCF]
%   $\I$ is not Boolean.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
%   If $\I$ is Boolean, then $\I = 2$ by Corollary~\ref{cor:field}, since in that case we have for any $i : \I$,
%   \[ \ms ti \vee \ms fi = \ms ti \vee \ms t\neg i = \ms t(i \vee \neg i) = 1. \]
%   However, this contradicts Lemma~\ref{lem:discretephoa}, because if $\I = 2$ then $2^\I = 2^2$, which cannot be equivalent to $2$.
% \end{proof}

% Furthermore, (L) also allows us to define more affine spaces:

% \begin{example}[L]
%   Consider the right outer horn $\Lambda^2_2$ as a pushout,
%   \[
%     \begin{tikzcd}
%       1 \ar[d, "1"'] \ar[r, "1"] & \I \ar[d] \\
%       \I \ar[r] & \Lambda^2_2
%       \arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125, rotate=180}, draw=none, from=2-2, to=1-1]
%     \end{tikzcd}
%   \]
%   By viewing $\Lambda^2_2$ as a subspace of $\I^2$, we may identify it as follows,
%   \[ \Lambda^2_2 = \scomp{i,j : \I}{\ms ti \vee \ms tj}. \]
%   Since $\ms ti \vee \ms tj = \ms t(i\vee j)$, it follows that 
%   \[ \Lambda^2_2 = \spec \I[i,j]/i \vee j. \]
% \end{example}

% The most important consequence of (L) is that it allows us to show specialisation posets are closed under dependent sums over certain affine spaces:

% \begin{definition}[SQCF]
%   We say an affine space $X$ is \emph{finitary}, if it is of the form $\spec\I[n]/s=t$ for some finitely presented $\I$-algebra. $X$ is thus a subspace of $\I^n$, and we say $X$ is \emph{topped}, if $1 : \I^n$ belongs to $X$.
% \end{definition}

% \begin{example}
%   All the finitary examples of affine spaces considered so far, including the cubes $\I^n$, the simplices $\Delta^n$ and $\Delta_n$, and the outer horn $\Lambda^2_2$, are all topped.
% \end{example}

% One interesting fact is that, since $\I$ is a dominance, it will always be orthogonal to the following family of maps:

% \begin{lemma}[SQCF]\label{lem:toppedfamilyortho}
%   Let $X$ be a finitary topped affine space, $Y : X \to \tp$ a type family. Then $\I$ is weakly orthogonal to the embedding $Y_1 \hook \sum_{i : X}Y_i$,
%   \[
%   \begin{tikzcd}
%     Y_1 \ar[d, hook] \ar[r, "f"] & \I \\ 
%     \sum_{i : X} Y_i \ar[ur, dashed, "\qsi f"']
%   \end{tikzcd}
%   \]
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
%   Using the dominance structure, we define $\qsi f$ as follows,
%   \[ \qsi f(i,y) := \sum_{*:\ms ti} f(y). \]
%   This is well-defined, and evidently extends $f$.
% \end{proof}

% For any finitary topped $X$, by viewing it as a subspace of $\I^n$, we may define the generalised lifting functor over $X$ as follows:
% \[ L_XY := \sum_{i:X}Y^{\ms ti}. \]
% Of course, $L_\I$ is the usual lifting functor $(-)\prt$. The most crucial observation of this section is that specialisation posets are closed under generalised liftings:

% \begin{theorem}[L, SQCF]\label{thm:specialisationordergenlifting}
%   Let $X$ be a finitary topped affine space and $Y$ a specialisation poset. Then the specialisation order on $L_XY$ is given by
%   \[ (i,x) \preceq (j,y) \eq \ms ti \to (\ms tj \wedge x \preceq_{Y} y). \]
%   In particular, $L_XY$ is again a specialisation order.
% \end{theorem}
% \begin{proof}
%   Recall from Lemma~\ref{lem:orderonaffine} the specialisation order on $X$ is induced from the point-wise order on $\I^n$. For the left to right direction, if $(i,x) \preceq (j,y)$, then by monotonicity $i \le j$. If $\ms ti$ holds, then $\ms tj$ holds, and $x \preceq_Y y$ since by Lemma~\ref{lem:toppedfamilyortho} any map $Y \to \I$ extends to one on $L_XY$.

%   On the other hand, suppose we have $(i,x) \preceq (j,y)$ in $L_XY$. We construct a map $f : \I \to L_XY$. On the base, it must take $k$ to $i \vee k \wedge j$. Hence, assuming $\ms t(i \vee k \wedge j)$, we need an element in $Y$. By (L), equivalently $\ms ti \vee \ms tk \wedge \ms tj$. Thus, we can define this by case distinction:
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item If $\ms ti$ holds, then since $x \preceq_Y y$, by the fact that $Y$ is a specialisation poset, we get a unique map $g : \I \to X$, and we define $f(k) := g(k)$.
%     \item If $\ms tk \wedge \ms tj$ holds, we simply put $fk := y$.
%   \end{itemize}
%   This is evidently well-defined, thus we get a map $f : \I \to L_XY$.
% \end{proof}

% Of course, we can also consider the dual notion of \emph{bottomed} finitary affine spaces, which are affine subspaces of $\I^n$ containing $0$. However, to develop the same arguments, we would have to assume furthermore the \emph{colocality} axiom as follows,

% \begin{axiom}[cL]
%   $\I$ is colocal, i.e. $0 \neq 1$ and $\ms f(i \wedge j) \eq \ms fi \vee \ms fj$.
% \end{axiom}

% And in this case, for any bottomed finitary affine space $X$ we can construct the generalised colifting of a type $Y$ as
% \[ T_XY := \sum_{i:X}Y^{\ms fi}. \]
% We then similarly have the following result:

% \begin{theorem}[cL, SQCF]\label{thm:specialisationordergencolifting}
%   Let $X$ be a finitary bottomed affine space and $Y$ a specialisation poset. Then the specialisation order on $T_XY$ is given by
%   \[ (i,x) \preceq (j,y) \eq \ms fj \to (\ms fi \wedge x \preceq_{Y} y). \]
%   In particular, $T_XY$ is again a specialisation order.
% \end{theorem}

% Of course, it is perfectly fine to assume both (L) and (cL), and we may refer to the combination of them as (bL). Working in the context of (bL), we again recover the full duality between the meet and join structure as the presheaf geometry.

\section{Local properties for affine spaces}

In this section we review some of the locality axioms we have introduced in Section~\ref{sec:locality}. The observation is that, even if we do not assume them to be true globally for the internval $\I$, we can still show the maps representing the locality axiom to be \emph{orthogonal} to $\I$, or more generally for all affine spaces. Again, these orthogonality conditions are completely due to the algebraic properties of distributive lattices. 

As a starting example, let us observe that the inner horn $\Lambda^2_1$ can be constructed as the following pushout,
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    1 \ar[d, "0"'] \ar[r, "1"] & \I \ar[d] \\
    \I \ar[r] & \Lambda^2_1
    \arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125, rotate=180}, draw=none, from=2-2, to=1-1]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
It is essentially observed in~\cite{riehl2017type} that the inclusion $\Lambda^2_1 \hook \Delta_2$ can be defined in type theory as follows,
\[ \Lambda^2_1 = \scomp{(i,j) : \Delta_2}{\ms fi \vee \ms tj}. \]

\begin{definition}
  We say $X$ is \emph{Segal} if it is orthogonal to $\Lambda^2_1 \hook \Delta^2$.
\end{definition}

As a first example, all affine spaces will be Segal:

\begin{lemma}
  Any affine space $X$ is Segal.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $X = \spec A$ be affine, and let $f,g : \I \to X$ be two maps with $f(1) = g(0)$. By Proposition~\ref{prop:duality}, these are equivalently two maps between $\I$-algebras
  \[ f^*,g^* : A \to \I[x], \]
  with $f^*(a)(1) = g^*(a)(0)$ for all $a:A$. Now to define $h : \Delta_2 \to X$, equivalently we want to define $h^* : A \to \I[x,y]/x \le y$,
  \[ h^*(a) := f^*(a)(0) \vee y \wedge f^*(a)(1) \vee x \wedge g^*(a)(1). \]
  This is well-defined by Proposition~\ref{prop:simplicesasalgebra}.
\end{proof}

Furthermore, we verify that affine spaces are 1-truncated in the following sense:

\begin{definition}
  $X$ is \emph{1-truncated}, if it is orthogonal to $\partial\Delta_2 \hook \Delta_2$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  Affine spaces are 1-truncated.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $X = \spec A$ be affine. By quasi-coherence, $[f,h,g] : \partial\Delta_2 \to X$ consists of three maps
  \[ f^*,h^*,g^* : A \to \I[x], \]
  where for any $a : A$,
  \[ f^*(a)(0) = h^*(a)(0), \quad f^*(a)(1) = g^*(a)(0), \quad h^*(a)(1) = g^*(a)(1). \]
  Now to give $\Delta_2 \to X$, equivalently we need $u : A \to \I[x,y]/x \le y$, which by Proposition~\ref{prop:simplicesasalgebra} we may define it to be
  \[ u(a) : f^*(a) \vee y \wedge h^*(a) \vee x \wedge g^*(a). \]
  This is well-defined, since by definition $f^*(a) \le h^*(a) \le g^*(a)$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  We say $X$ is \emph{simplicial} if it is orthogonal to $\Delta^2 \cup \Delta_2 \hook \I^2$.
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}
  Any affin space are simplicial.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  This is a consequence of being Segal and 1-truncated.
\end{proof}

 

Following~\cite{buchholtz2021synthetic}, we can define the type of free equivalence $\mbb E$ as the following colimit,
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
	& \I && \I && \I \\
	1 && {\Delta_2} && {\Delta_2} && 1
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-1]
	\arrow["{d_1}"{description}, from=1-2, to=2-3]
	\arrow["{d_2}"{description}, from=1-4, to=2-3]
	\arrow["{d_0}"{description}, from=1-4, to=2-5]
	\arrow["{d_1}"{description}, from=1-6, to=2-5]
	\arrow[from=1-6, to=2-7]
\end{tikzcd}
\]

\begin{definition}
  We say $X$ is \emph{Rezk}, if it is orthogonal to $\mbb E \to 1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  Affine spaces are Rezk.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Since an affine space $X$ is 1-truncated, a map $\mbb E \to X$ is completely determined by three edges $f,g,h : \I \to X$, where $g,h$ are inverses to $f$. Now $X$ is Rezk follows from the fact that its order is a poset.
\end{proof}

Finally, we can also construct $\I_{\rightrightarrows}$ as the following pushout,
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  2 \ar[r] \ar[d] & \I \ar[d] \\ 
  \I \ar[r] & \I_{\rightrightarrows}
  \arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125, rotate=180}, draw=none, from=2-2, to=1-1]
\end{tikzcd}
\]

\begin{definition}
  We say $X$ is \emph{$\I$-separated}, if $X^{\I} \to X^{\I_\rightrightarrows}$ is an equivalence.
\end{definition}

Equivalently, $X$ is $\I$-separated iff $X^\I \to X \times X$ is an embedding. The following is evident:

\begin{lemma}
  Any affine space, or any Phoa type, is $\I$-separated.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Evident from definition.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  Unless we assume the very strong locality principle (1T), Phoa types will in general \emph{not} be Segal or Rezk, since there is in general no control of maps $\Delta_2 \to X$ for a specialisation poset $X$.
\end{remark}

The notion of categories and posets are formulated internally as these orthogonality classes:

\begin{definition}
  A type $X$ is a \emph{category}, if it is simplitial, Segal, and Rezk. We say it is a \emph{poset}, if it is also $\I$-separated.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:affineposet}
  Any affine space $X$ is a poset.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}[SQCF]
  Quasi-coherent $\I$-algebras will be posets.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  This follows from the fact that $\I$ is affine, hence a poset, and that if $A$ is quasi-coherent then $A = \I^{\spec A}$.
\end{proof}

At the end of this section, we would like to show that the previous orthogonality classes have various closure properties. In particular, we would like to show they are closed under \emph{dependent sums over discrete sets}, and \emph{sequential colimits}. 

\begin{lemma}[NT, SQCF]\label{lem:disccoprod}
  $\prod_{i:\N}$ commutes with $\sum_{m:M}$ with $M$ discrete, i.e. for any type family $P$ over $\I,M$, the canonical map
  \[ \sum_{m:M}\prod_{i:\N}P_{i,m} \to \prod_{i:\I}\sum_{m:M}P_{i,m} \]
  is an equivalences.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By definition, this map is an embedding, hence it suffices to show surjectivity. But this follows from Corollary~\ref{cor:connectedpreservediscrete}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[NT, SQCF]\label{prop:closuresum}
  For an orthogonality condition $f : X \to Y$, if both $X,Y$ are connected colimits of cubes or simplices, then $f$-local objects will be closed under dependent sums indexed by discrete sets.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let $Y = \lt_{r}Y_r$ be a connected limit of cubes or simplices,
  \[ \prth{\sum_{m:M}P_m}^Y \simeq \lt_r\prth{\sum_{m:M}\lt_{r}P_m}^{Y_r} \simeq \sum_{m : M}\lt_r P_m^{Y_r} \simeq \sum_{m:M} P_m^Y. \]
  The second equivalence uses the fact that finite connected limits commutes with dependent sums, and by Lemma~\ref{lem:disccoprod} $Y_r$ also commutes with dependent sums indexed by $M$. Similarly for $X$. Hence, if each $P_m$ is $f$-local, then so is $\sum_{m:M}P_m$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  All the orthogonality classes introduced in this section are closed under dependent sums indexed by discrete sets.
\end{corollary}

Completely similarly, we consider the case for sequential colimits. To show this closure property, we need to assume a choice principle:

\begin{definition}
  For any type $X$, we say it is $k$-projective if for all $k$-truncated type families $P$ over $X$,
  \[ \prod_{x:X} \pss{P(x)} \to \pss{\prod_{x:X}P(x)}. \]
  We say $X$ is $\omega$-projective if this holds for any $k$, and $\infty$-projective if this holds for any $P$.
\end{definition}

\begin{axiom}[PF$_\infty$]
  $\I$ is $\infty$-projective.
\end{axiom}

\begin{remark}
  The $\infty$-projective objects will be closed under finite products and retracts, thus under (PF$_\infty$), the cubes $\I^n$ and the simplices $\Delta^n$ will also be $\infty$-projective.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}[NT, PF$_\infty$, SQCF]\label{lem:sequentialcolimit}
  $\prod_{i:\N}$ commutes with sequential colimit for all $k$-truncated type families: If $P_{i,n}$ is a $k$-truncated type family with transition maps $\tau_{i,n} : P_{i,n} \to P_{i,n+1}$ for all $i:\I,n : \N$, then the canonical map
  \[ \ct_{n:\N}\prod_{i:\I} P_{i,n} \to \prod_{i:\I}\ct_{n:\N}P_{i,n} \]
  is an equivalence, and similarly for $\I^n,\Delta^n$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We prove this by induction on the truncation level. For $P_{i,n}$ contractible, by~\citep[Lem. 7.2]{10.1145/3373718.3394801} both $\ct_{n:\N}\prod_{i:\I} P_{i,n}$ and $\prod_{i:\I}\ct_{n:\N}P_{i,n}$ are contractible, hence an equivalence.

  Now suppose $P$ is a family of $k+1$-types. Given two canonical elements $[(0,f)],[(0,g)]$ in the colimit $\ct_{n:\N}\prod_{i:\I}P_{i,n}$, recall from~\cite{10.1145/3373718.3394801}, we have
  \[ [(0,f)] = [(0,g)] \simeq \ct_{n:\N} \tau_nf = \tau_ng \simeq \ct_{n:\N} \prod_{i:\I} \tau_nfi = \tau_ngi. \]
  On the other hand, we have
  \[ \prod_{i:\I}[(0,fi)] = [(0,gi)] = \prod_{i:\I}\ct_{n:\N}\tau_nfi = \tau_ngi. \]
  The two types are equivalent by induction hypothesis, since the identity types are $k$-truncated. This means the map is an embedding.

  To show surjectivity, suppose we have $f : \prod_{i:\I}\ct_{n:\N}P_{i,n}$. Now by construction, 
  \[ \fa i\I \ex n\N \ex y{P_{i,n}} f(i) = [(n,y)]. \]
  By (PF$_\infty$), and Corollary~\ref{cor:connectedpreservediscrete}, we merely get a section $f : \prod_{i:\N} P_{i,n}$ for some $n$, which shows surjectivity.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  Notice that the first half of the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:sequentialcolimit} does not rely on any properties of $\I$, hence this shows that for \emph{any} type $X$,
  \[ \ct_{n:\N}\prod_{x:X} P_{x,n} \to \prod_{x:X}\ct_{n:\N}P_{x,n} \]
  is an embedding, for $P$ a $k$-truncated family.
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}[NT, PF$_\infty$, SQCF]
  For $f : X \to Y$, if both $X,Y$ are finite colimits of cubes or simplices, then $k$-truncated $f$-local objects are closed under sequential colimits for all $k$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  The proof is similar to Proposition~\ref{prop:closuresum}, by using Lemma~\ref{lem:sequentialcolimit} and realising that finite limits commutes with sequential colimits.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:infdomain}, $\omega = \ct_{n:\N}\Delta^n$ is the sequential colimit of the simplices. Hence, assuming (NT), (PF$_\infty$), and (SQCC), $\omega$ will also be a poset.
\end{example}

\section{A discussion on the models}

It is now instructive to discuss models for the quasi-coherence principle for countably presented algebras. We observe that the proof of the quasi-coherence principle in the classifying topos $\Set[\T] = [\mmod\T\fp,\Set]$ for finitely presented algebras given in~\cite{blechschmidt2020general,blechschmidt2021using} can be completely adapted to the countably presented case, provided we work with a larger site,
\[ \Set[\T]_\infty := [\mmod\T\cp,\Set], \]
where $\mmod\T\cp$ is the category of \emph{countably presented} $\T$-models. These two topoi are intimately related. In particular, we have an inclusion
\[ \mmod\T\fp \hook \mmod\T\cp, \]
which preserves finite colimits. Hence, by e.g.~\cite[Thm. 7.20]{caramello2019denseness}, it induces an adjoint triple,
\[\begin{tikzcd}
  {\Set[\T]_\infty} & {\Set[\T]}
  \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "\Gamma"{description}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
  \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "\Delta"', curve={height=18pt}, from=1-2, to=1-1]
  \arrow[""{name=2, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "\nabla", curve={height=-18pt}, from=1-2, to=1-1]
  \arrow["\dashv"{anchor=center, rotate=-90}, draw=none, from=0, to=2]
  \arrow["\dashv"{anchor=center, rotate=-90}, draw=none, from=1, to=0]
\end{tikzcd}\]
which makes $\Set[\T]_\infty \surj \Set[\T]$ a \emph{local geometric morphism.}

In the topos $\Set[\T]_\infty$, the generic $\T$-model $U_\T$ is again given by
\[ U_\T(A) = \geo{A}, \]
which takes $A$ to its underlying set. The quasi-coherence principle for countably presented $U_\T$-algebras will hold for any subtopos of $\Set[\T]_\infty$ where $U_\T$ is a sheaf; cf.~\cite[Thm. 4.11.]{blechschmidt2020general}. For instance, this is the theoretical basis of the quasi-coherence principle for countably presented Boolean algebras in the topos of light condensed sets introduced by Clausen and Scholze, as shown in~\cite{cherubini2024foundation}. Furthermore, if we restrict the topology $J$ on $\mmod\T\cp$ to one on $\mmod\T\cp$, the adjoint triple mentioned above will restrict to one to the sheaf subtopoi,
\[\begin{tikzcd}
  {\sh(\mmod\T\cp\op,J)} & {\sh(\mmod\T\fp\op,J)}
  \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "\Gamma"{description}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
  \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "\Delta"', curve={height=18pt}, from=1-2, to=1-1]
  \arrow[""{name=2, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "\nabla", curve={height=-18pt}, from=1-2, to=1-1]
  \arrow["\dashv"{anchor=center, rotate=-90}, draw=none, from=0, to=2]
  \arrow["\dashv"{anchor=center, rotate=-90}, draw=none, from=1, to=0]
\end{tikzcd}\]
which identifies $\sh(\mmod\T\cp\op,J)$ a local topos over $\sh(\mmod\T\fp\op,J)$.

For $\mbb D$ the theory of distributive lattices, we have a more detailed description of the dual category $\DL\cp\op$. Recall that there is a duality between distributive lattices and \emph{spectral spaces},
\[ \spec : \DL\op \simeq \Spec : \Sigma. \]
Here $\Spec$ is the category of spectral topological spaces and spectral maps. A spectral space $X$ is a sober topological space, such that its compact open subsets form a basis, i.e. they are closed under finite intersections and every open subset is a union of compact ones. A continuous map between spectral spaces $f : X \to Y$ is called \emph{spectral}, if $f\inv$ furthermore preserves compact opens. For more information on this duality result, see e.g. Stone's original paper~\cite{stone1938topological} or the detailed exposition~\cite{bezhanishvili2010bitopological}.

On one hand, $\spec$ takes a distributive lattice $A$ to its \emph{space of models}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A point is a morphism $x : A \to 2$ in $\DL$;
  \item Subsets of the form $D_a$ with $a\in A$ form a basis, with 
  \[ D_a := \scomp{x \in \spec A}{x(a) = 1}. \]
\end{itemize}
It is easy to verify that the basis of the form $D_a$ are in fact compact, and hence $\spec A$ is a spectral space. Furthermore, given a morphism $f : A \to B$, there is an induced map
\[ f^* : \spec B \to \spec A, \]
given by precomposition with $f$. In this case it is easy to verify $(f^*)\inv(D_a) = D_{fa}$, thus $f^*$ is spectral.

\begin{remark}
  Though $\Spec$ is not a full subcategory of $\Topp$, it is still closed under limits in $\Topp$. One way to see this is via $\spec : \DL\op \simeq \Spec$, where we may explicitly compute the limit of spectral spaces as colimits of distributive lattices.
\end{remark}

As an example, let us look at the space of models of the countably generated free distributive lattice $2[\N]$, where we have 
\[ \spec 2[\N] \cong \Sigma^\N. \] 
Here $\Sigma$ is the Sierpinski space. This is due to the fact that
\[ \spec 2[\N] \cong \spec\coprod_{\N} 2[x] \cong \prod_{\N} \spec 2[x] \cong \Sigma^\N, \]
where it is easy to verify that $\spec 2[x] \cong \Sigma$. 

On the other hand, the functor $\Sigma : \Spec \to \DL\op$ simply takes a spectral space $X$ to the distributive lattice 
\[ \Sigma(X) := \Spec(X,\Sigma), \]
In other words, $\Sigma(X)$ is the distributive lattice of compact opens of $X$.

Let us now consider the essential image of $\spec : \DL\cp\op \to \Spec$, which we denote as $\wSpec$. Notice that since a distributive lattice is countably presented iff it is a quotient of $2[\N]$. The fact that every quotient of $2[\N]$ is countably presented follows from the fact that $2[\N]$ is itself countable. This way, by duality objects in $\wSpec$ are simply spectral subspaces of $\Sigma^\N$, i.e. those subspaces $X \subseteq \Sigma^\N$, where for any compact open $U$ of $\Sigma^\N$, $X \cap U$ is again compact in $X$. 

\begin{remark}
  In particular, not all subspaces of $\Sigma^\N$ will lie in $\wSpec$, since in particular objects in $\wSpec$ are themselves \emph{compact}. For instance, the discrete space $\N$ is a subspace of $\Sigma^\N$, but not an object in $\wSpec$.
\end{remark}

This way, we have the following situation,
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  \DL\fp\op \ar[r, "\simeq"] \ar[d, hook] & \Pos\fp \ar[d, hook] \\ 
  \DL\cp\op \ar[r, "\simeq"] & \wSpec 
\end{tikzcd}
\]
where the equivalence $\DL\cp\op \simeq \wSpec$ restricts to one between finite distributive lattices and finite posets, where we view each finite poset as a spectral space via its Scott topology.

Working with $\wSpec$, the generic distributive lattice $\I$ as a presheaf on $\wSpec$ is now the representable functor on the Sierpinski space $\Sigma$. This way, all the examples of models we get for (SQCC) are based on a topology $J$ on $\wSpec$ making $\yon_\Sigma$ a sheaf. Below are the corresponding examples for the locality principles we have considered in Section~\ref{sec:locality}.

\begin{example}[NT]
  To model (NT), we would want the empty sieve on $\spec(2/0=1) = \emp$ to be a covering. Since $\emp$ is a strict initial object in $\wSpec$, this is a subcanonical topology. Thus, this gives us a least topology $J_{\ms{NT}}$ that models (NT), and we have
  \[ \sh(\wSpec,J_{\ms{NT}}) \simeq \psh(\wSpec_+), \]
  where $\wSpec_+$ is the full subcategory of $\wSpec$ excluding $\emp$. The induced local geometric morphism now is given by 
  \[ \Gamma : \psh(\wSpec_+) \surj \psh(\Pos_{\mr{f.p.,+}}), \]
  where, again $\Pos_{\mr{f.p.,+}}$ is the full subcategory of $\Pos_{\mr{f.p.,+}}$ consisting of non-empty posets, and $\psh(\Pos_{\mr{f.,+}})$ is the classifying topos for non-trivial distributive lattices.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[L]
  The additional axiom for (L) besides (NT) is that 
  \[ x \vee y = 1 \vdash x = 1 \vee y = 1, \] 
  This means the dual embeddings of the following quotients needs to be a covering family,
  \[ 2[y] \cong 2[x,y]/x = 1 \twoheadleftarrow 2[x,y]/x\vee y \surj 2[x,y]/y=1 \cong 2[x]. \]
  It is easy to see that $\spec 2[x,y]/x \vee y$ is the space $\Lambda^2_1$ obtained by glueing the open points of two copies of Sierpinski spaces together, i.e. it is the following pushout,
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    1 \ar[d, "1"'] \ar[r, "1"] & \Sigma \ar[d, "l"] \\ 
    \Sigma \ar[r, "r"'] & \Lambda^2_1
    \arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125, rotate=180}, draw=none, from=2-2, to=1-1]    
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  The least topology $J_{\ms L}$ is thus generated by the empty covering on $\emp$, and the covering $\set{l,r : \Sigma \to \Lambda^2_1}$. Since we have the pushout above, this topology is again subcanonical. 
  
  In this case, we can also have an explicit description of a covering family in $\wSpec$: A family of maps is a $\ms J_{\ms L}$ covering on $X \in \wSpec$ iff it contains a (finite) subfamily of \emph{compact opens} $\set{X_i\subseteq X}_{i\in I}$, where $X = \bigcup_{i\in I}X_i$. This is thus the \emph{Zariski topology} on $\wSpec$, and the local geometric morphism
  \[ \sh(\wSpec,J_{\ms L}) \surj \sh(\Pos\fp,J_{\ms L}) \simeq \mb{Zar}(\mbb D), \]
  is over the \emph{Zariski topos} $\mb{Zar}(\mbb D)$ for distributive lattices.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[SL]
  An even stronger axiom is the linearity axiom, 
  \[ \top \vdash x \le y \vee y \le x, \]
  which requires the dual embeddings of the following quotients to form a covering family,
  \[ 2[x,y]/x \le y \twoheadleftarrow 2[x,y] \surj 2[x,y]/y \le x. \]
  We can compute that $\spec 2[x,y] \cong \Sigma^2$, and 
  \[ \spec(2[x,y]/x \le y) \cong \Sigma_2 = \set{0 < 1 < 2}. \]
  Again we have a pushout diagram,
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \Sigma \ar[r, "\partial"] \ar[d, "\partial"'] & \Sigma_2 \ar[d, "l"] \\ 
    \Sigma_2 \ar[r, "r"'] & \Sigma^2
    \arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125, rotate=180}, draw=none, from=2-2, to=1-1]
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  where $\partial : \Sigma \to \Sigma_2$ maps $\Sigma$ to the end points of $\Sigma_2$, and $l,r : \Sigma_2 \hook \Sigma^2$ is the two $\Sigma_2$-chains in $\Sigma^2$. The least topology $\ms J_{\ms{SL}}$ for the linearity axiom is thus generated by the empty covering on $\emp$, and $\set{l,r : \Sigma_2 \hook \Sigma^2}$. Similarly, given this pushout, $J_{\ms{SL}}$ will be subcanonical.

  The topos $\sh(\wSpec,J_{\ms{SL}})$ is closely related to simplicial sets. This is due to the fact that simplicial sets is the classifying topos of non-empty linear orders (cf. e.g.~\cite{maclane2012sheaves}), and thus we have an equivalence 
  \[ \sh(\Pos\fp,J_{\ms{SL}}) \simeq \psh(\Delta). \]
  This makes $\sh(\wSpec,J_{\ms{SL}}) \surj \psh(\Delta)$ a local topos over simplicial sets.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[1T]
  Similarly to the case of (SL), the 1-truncation axiom requires dual embeddings of the following quotient maps
  \[\begin{tikzcd}
    & {2[x,y]/x\le y} \\
    {2[x,y]/x=0} & {2[x,y]/x=y} & {2[x,y]/y=1}
    \arrow[two heads, from=1-2, to=2-1]
    \arrow[two heads, from=1-2, to=2-2]
    \arrow[two heads, from=1-2, to=2-3]
  \end{tikzcd}\]
  to be a covering, which translates to the fact that the three inclusions
  \[ d_0,d_1,d_2 : \Sigma \hook \Sigma_2 \]
  covers $\Sigma_2$. Again we have a colimit diagram as follows, 
  \[\begin{tikzcd}
    1 & 1 & 1 \\
    \Sigma & \Sigma & \Sigma \\
    & {\Sigma_2}
    \arrow["0"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
    \arrow["1"{description, pos=0.25}, from=1-1, to=2-2]
    \arrow["0"{description, pos=0.25}, from=1-2, to=2-1]
    \arrow["1"{description, pos=0.25}, from=1-2, to=2-3]
    \arrow["0"{description, pos=0.25}, from=1-3, to=2-2]
    \arrow["0", from=1-3, to=2-3]
    \arrow["{d_0}"', from=2-1, to=3-2]
    \arrow["{d_1}"{description}, from=2-2, to=3-2]
    \arrow["{d_2}", from=2-3, to=3-2]
  \end{tikzcd}\]
  which implies $J_{\ms{1T}}$ is subcanonical.
  
  Similar to the case of (SL), $\sh(\wSpec,J_{\ms{1T}})$ is closely related to the topos of \emph{truncated simplicial sets} $\psh(\Delta_{\le 1})$. This is again induced by the fact that the classifying topos for 1-truncated distributive lattices is given by 
  \[ \sh(\Pos\fp,J_{\ms{1T}}) \simeq \psh(\Delta_{\le 1}). \]
  Hence, this again gives us a local geometric morphism
  \[ \sh(\wSpec,J_{\ms{1T}}) \surj \psh(\Delta_{\le 1}). \]
\end{example}

% In this section we work with $\ms{ZFC}$. Let $\sFrm$ be the category of $\sigma$-frames, i.e. whose objects are posets with finite meets and countable joins, where they distribute through each other. We will also use $\sFrm\cp$ to denote the full subcategory of countably presented $\sigma$-frames.

% The first observation is that any c.p. $\sigma$-frame $A$ is indeed a \emph{frame}. This is clear for all finitely presented $\sigma$-frames, since they are simply finite distributive lattices. To see this for the countable case, consider the countably generated free $\sigma$-frame $2[\N]$:

% \begin{lemma}\label{lem:cgfreesframe}
%   We have an isomorphism
%   \[ 2[\N] \cong [P_f(\N),2], \]
%   where $P_f(\N)$ is the poset of finite subsets of $\N$.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
%   The free $\sigma$-frame can be generated by first freely adding finite meets to the discrete poset $\N$, and then freely adding all countable joins. The first step results in the poset $P_f(\N)\op$. Now since $P_f(\N)\op$ is countable, freely adding all countable joins is equivalently freely adding \emph{all} joins, which is achieved by the presheaf construction. This way,
%   \[ 2[\N] = [(P_f(\N)\op)\op,2] \cong [P_f(\N),2]. \qedhere \]
% \end{proof}

% \begin{corollary}\label{cor:dualsframe}
%   There is a fully faithful embedding
%   \[ \sFrm\cp \hook \Frm, \]
%   preserving all countable colimits. This is again fully faithful when composed with $\ms{pt} : \Frm\op \to \Topp$. 
% \end{corollary}
% \begin{proof}
%   By definition, a c.p. $\sigma$-frame is isomorphic to one of the form $2[\N]/R$ for some countably generated equivalence relation $R$. Since by Lemma~\ref{lem:cgfreesframe} $2[\N]$ is a frame, so is any of its quotient. By a result in~\cite[Thm. 6.2.4]{makkai2006first}, such frames are indeed \emph{spatial}, hence they fully faithfully embed into the category of topological spaces via the functor $\pt$.
% \end{proof}

% This way, we get a duality between c.p. $\sigma$-frames and certain class of topological spaces. Notice that since all c.p. $\sigma$-frame will be a quotient of $2[\N]$, their dual spaces will be a subspace of $\pt(2[\N])$, which we can compute quite easily:

% \begin{lemma}
%   The space of points of $2[\N]$ is the Scott's graph model $G$, which is the countable product of the Sierpinski space $G \cong S^\N$.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
%   Note $\pt$ takes colimits in $\Frm$ to limits in $\Topp$, since $\pt : \Loc \to \Topp$ is a right adjoint. Since $2[\N]$ is the countable coproduct of the free frame on one generator, we have
%   \[ \pt(2[\N]) \cong \pt(2[x])^\N \cong S^\N, \]
%   where $\pt(2[x])$ is the Sierpinski space $S$ by an easy computation.
% \end{proof}

% However, to connect to models in~\cite{FIORE1997151}, we need to connect $\sFrm\cp$ with $\wCPO$. To do this, we first observe the following fact:

% \begin{proposition}
%   Let $\mb P$ be the full subcategory of $\wCPO$ consisting of retracts of Scott's graph model $G$. Then we have a fully faithful embedding 
%   \[ i : \mb P \hook \sFrm\cp\op. \]
% \end{proposition}
% \begin{proof}
%   Since both $\wCPO$ and $\Topp$ are Cauchy complete, it suffices to notice that for the graph model $G$, by viewing it as an $\omega$CPO or a topological space, they give the same endomorphisms,
%   \[ \wCPO(G,G) \cong \Topp(G,G). \]
%   Hence, this follows from Corollary~\ref{cor:dualsframe}.
% \end{proof}

% \begin{theorem}
%   The inclusion $i : \mb P \hook \sFrm\cp\op$ induces an embedding,
%   \[ i : \psh(\mb P) \hook [\sFrm\cp,\Set], \]
%   where the generic model in $[\sFrm\cp,\Set]$ is an $i$-sheaf.
% \end{theorem}
% \begin{proof}
%   Note that the direct image $i_*$ is computed by right Kan extension, thus $i$ is an embedding because $i$ is fully faithful, and $i^*i_* \cong 1$. The generic model is the corepresentable $\yon^{2[\N]}$, which when restricting along $i^*$ becomes the representable $\yon_G$. Hence, it suffices to show $i_*\yon_G \cong \yon^{2[\N]}$. 
  
%   For any $A\in\sFrm\cp$, we compute
%   \[ i_*\yon_G(A) \cong \lt_{X\in A/\mb P}\mb P(X,P) \cong \lt_{D\in A/\mb P}\sFrm(2[\N],D). \]
%   Now we show the canonical map is an isomorphism:
%   \[ \sFrm(2[\N],A) \to \lt_{D\in A/\mb P}\sFrm(2[\N],D). \]
  
%   \emph{Injectivity}: Suppose we have two maps $f,g : 2[\N] \to A$. Notice that the singleton $1\in\mb P$, which corresponds to the initial frame $2$. Since $A \in \sFrm$ is spatial, if for all $x : A \to 2$ we have $xf = xg$, then $f = g$.

%   \emph{Surjectivity}: Suppose we are given a compatible family $\set{f_D}_{D\in A/\mb P}$ where $f_D : 2[\N] \to D$. By the duality in Corollary~\ref{cor:dualsframe}, equivalently we have a compatible family
%   \[ \scomp{f_X : X \to G}{X \in \mb P/\pt(A)}. \]
%   Now there is essentially one way to define a map $f : \pt(A) \to G$, by letting $f(x)$ for $x\in\pt(A)$ to be $f_x$,
%   \[
%   \begin{tikzcd}
%     1 \ar[d, "f_x"'] \ar[r, "x"] & \pt(A) \ar[dl, dashed, "f"] \\ 
%     G
%   \end{tikzcd}
%   \]
% \end{proof}
